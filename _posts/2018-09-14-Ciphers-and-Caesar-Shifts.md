    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>At first, I had been stuck with what to do concerning a Caesar Shift use Google Sheets. I had this issue as I had not completely understood what the requirements were in order for the vlookup function to work. I was able to persevere with this issue through logical trial and error. I ran through what I knew was correct initially and worked off of that. Eventually I ran into the right answer to how everything fit into place.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>Though I was unfamiliar with this specific topic (to a certain extent due to knowing the fundamentals of this form of coding), I did not have to question enough to say that I was able to use this skill. I primarily asked myself what might work, but beyond that was very little in this aspect.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>During the lesson, I was able to show independence through working on my own (as per normal). This showed more than that, however, because I had to work alone in order to work through an issue that I had brought myself to. Independence is a key skill for me to work on as I am quite awful at questioning as I will always attempt to rely on myself.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>In order to assist me in successfully creating the code to make Caesar Shift, I was able to reflect upon my experiences with Python to check for errors in my code instead of immediately turning to the internet.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I showed engagement in the lesson by focussing on the information presented in order to achieve as high a standard as I could.</td>

    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In retrospect to the lesson, it may have been easier and quicker to question what was I was meant to do in respect to a certain section of the function code. If I had done this, I could have brought more of the aforementioned skill into my lesson as I must work on it (as previously mentioned). Other than this, there is very little that I could have improved on in my learning due to very little happening other than learning the basics of functions in spreadsheets.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>As for the next lesson I have, I should work on making sure that I am trying to ask questions for if I need to instead of solely relying on myself, even when I am struggling to such a point that I can get little to no work done. As well as this, I hope that I can improve on expanding my understanding of the topic presented, which is still likely to be ciphers or shifts.</td>
