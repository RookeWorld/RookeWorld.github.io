    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I was determined to remember how to change the colour of a container in CSS.</td>

    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I did not use questioning to such an extent as there was little to ask about.</td>

    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Independence came from relying on myself to answer whatever small questions I had.</td>

    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>There was little opportunity to reflect.</td>

    <td>Engagement</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>As this was the first lesson back, there was very little for me to be able to fail or go wrong in. As a result of this, I would say that very little could have gone better during my learning this week.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>For my next lesson, I should have more to do, allowing me to have a target. As for now, I have no real way of improvement as shown by the previous answer. Though I have no actual target or improvement point, I am planning on making sure that I am able to work cooperatively with others when needs be, as this has been a small issue in the past.</td>
