<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Basic shifts available for use in spreadsheet.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>Find a balance between questioning and independence.</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>

    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>As is the same for the weeks before, I had to use perseverance so that I could complete tasks that I was finding more difficult - in this case, the =DEC2BIN function.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I was able to use questioning to an extent so that I was still able to progress independently, but also at a steady pace because I was able to resolve an issue and work around it using information from someone else, but then I would have to rely on myself to use it again.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>This is almost explained in the box above. I was able to use independence to a good amount to a point that I could base ideas off of others' suggestions and work off of them myself.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I had to reflect upon my previous week so that I could find a base in order to get a good midpoint between relying on me and relying on someone else.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I had to engage this week so that I could find out an easier way to complete the ASCII table in the spreadsheet. Due to being able to fully listen to the content of the lesson, I had an easier time getting the necessary work done.</td>
  </tr>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>To improve my learning overall, I may have been able to take more initiative and copy over a table earlier on in the lesson so that I would be able to advance more rather than trying to figure out another way. If I had thought of taking the table and putting it straight in, I would have saved quite a lot of time.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>To improve, I should try to doubt myself less, as I may be able to find something if I simply tried it, instead of saying no to the majority of ideas that I have. Also to improve my learning, I should give more things a go when I am working, so that I have a better way of knowing what works and what doesn't.</td>
