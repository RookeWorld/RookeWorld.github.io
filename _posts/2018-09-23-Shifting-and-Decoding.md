  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I had moved on from beginning my blog and was getting started in working with shifts and ciphers.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>Use more questioning for if needs be (according to the topic, primarily).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>I did use more questioning in this lesson.</td>

    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I used persevering in what was possibly the easiest means to point out - to endure struggles to get to the required answer. I did this by simply attempting failed tests in my ciphers again whilst keeping an eye on the edits made.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I used this skill far more in this lesson due to the fact that I was quite stuck when it came down to the decoding as I seemed to have the same lines (which I had done on my own) as a peer's, though their work did not have issues. As such, I asked them for some assistance.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>In this lesson, I used independence in the same way as I would with each week because at this moment in time, there seems to be little else, and so I used this skill by resolving certain situations myself instead of solely relying on others (as opposed to my previous target).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I was able to reflect on the work I had done in the lesson from the week before in order to get the correct instructions put into the spreadsheet.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>There was very little to engage into in this lesson as the only thing done was work on the spreadsheets the class had created. In this sense, I suppose that would mean engagement in the work as the primary example here.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In this week’s lesson, I could have learned more if I had been able to solve my decoding issue off of the get go and so I would be able to move on to the next topic in the spreadsheet *coding*. As well as this, I might have been able to use more independence as I was quite focussed on my target of talking to others when stuck. So, as this suggests, I think that I could have perhaps tried to have found a better midpoint as I was quite reliant on my peer when I was unable to initially complete a task - something I am usually unfamiliar with.</td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In order to improve my learning for next time, I should probably (as is suggested in the previous section of the blog) try to find a more equal point between using sufficient independence and also being able to use questioning to the best of my extent. As well as this, I may also want to find simpler solutions quicker because I was trying too hard to figure out something I didn’t have to do - luckily it didn’t halt progress for too long.</td>
